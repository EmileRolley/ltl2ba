{1 The context}

This program has been implemented during the course {i Introduction à la
vérification} of the University of Bordeaux.

The goal is to implement {!section-algo} used to translate a LTL formula into
an equivalent {!section-genbuch}.

{1:algo The algorithm}

{i This algorithm is taken from the course {e Introduction à la vérification}
written by {{:https://www.labri.fr/profil/Zeitoun_ID1120210651}Marc Zeitoun}.}

Let φ be an LTL formula.

{2 The first phase}

The first phase consists in putting φ in {i negation normal form} (NNF), where:

- all negation appear only in front of the atomic propositions,
- only other logical operators [∧], and [∨] can appear, and
- only the temporal operator [X], [U], and [R] can appear.

{3 The negation normal form}

To calculate {i nnf(φ)}, following rules can be applied recursively -- see
{!val: Ltl.nnf}:

- nnf(ρ) = ρ
- nnf(¬¬φ) = nnf(φ)
- nnf(¬(φ ∨ ψ)) = nnf(¬φ) ∧ nnf(¬ψ)
- nnf(¬(φ ∧ ψ)) = nnf(¬φ) ∨ nnf(¬ψ)
- nnf(¬Xφ) = X nnf(¬φ)
- nnf(¬(φ U ψ)) = nnf(¬φ) R nnf(¬ψ)
- nnf(¬(φ R ψ)) = nnf(¬φ) U nnf(¬ψ)

{2:second The second phase}

For the second phase, let reassign φ as {i nnf(φ)} and define 𝒜 = (S, ⟶, S{_0},
F{_1}, ..., F{_k}) as the equivalent Büchi automata of φ. An automata state s ∈
S is a subset of sub-formulas of φ and the initial state S{_0} is \{φ\}.

{3:reduce Reduced subset}

A subset Z of formulas in NNF is {b reduced} if:

- formulas of Z are of the form: p, ¬q, or Xα,
- ⊥ ∉ Z, and ∀.p ∈ AP, \{p, ¬p\} ⊈ Z.

{3 Transitions}

In order to define transitions from a state Y, an oriented graph is build from
Y. Let Y = Z ∪ \{α\} where α is not a {!section-reduce} and is {b maximal} in Y
(i.e. α is not a sub-formula of any other such formula of Y).
Edges from Y are:

- If α = α{_1} ∨ α{_2}, Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{α{_1}\} and Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{α{_2}\}.
- If α = α{_1} ∧ α{_2}, Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{α{_1}, α{_2}\}.
- If α = α{_1} R α{_2}, Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{α{_1}, α{_2}\} and Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{Xα, α{_2}\}.
- If α = α{_1} U α{_2}, Y ⟶ Z ∪ \{α{_2}\} and Y ⟶{^α} Z ∪ \{Xα, α{_1}\}.

The symbol ⟶{^α} means the edge is {b marked} by α.

Then, is defined:

- Red(Y) = \{Z reduced | Y ⟶{^*} Z\}
- Red{_α}(Y) = \{Z reduced | Y ⟶{^*} without using an edge marked by α\}

When all formulas in Z are reduced, is defined:

- next(Z) = \{α | Xα ∈ Z\}
- Σ{_Z} the intersection of all p and ¬p in Z.

Finally, transitions from Y are: \{Y ⟶{^Σ{_Z}} next(Z) | Z ⊆ Red(Y)\}. Is added
an {b acceptance condition} for each sub-formula α wich is an Until: F{_α} =
\{Y ⟶{^Σ{_Z}} next(Z) | Y ⊆ Q and Z ⊆ Red{_α}(Y)\}.

{3:genbuch Generalized Büchi automata on transitions}

At the end the automata built, is a generalized Büchi automata {i on
transitions}: it's similar to generalized Büchi automata except that {b
acceptance conditions are set of transitions} instead of set of states. A {b
run} from the initial state is accepted, if for each acceptance conditions, it
goes infinitely often through a transition of this condition.

{2 Summary}

The automata 𝒜 = (S, ⟶, S{_0}, F{_1}, ..., F{_k}) equivalent to the formula φ,
is defined with:

- Initial state: S{_0} = \{φ\}
- Transitions from a state Y: \{Y ⟶{^Σ{_Z}} next(Z) | Z ⊆ Red(Y)\}
- Acceptance conditions: ∀.α ∈ φ, with α = α{_1} U α{_2}: F{_α} =
\{Y ⟶{^Σ{_Z}} next(Z) | Y ⊆ Q and Z ⊆ Red{_α}(Y)\}

{i NOTE: what's Q?}

{2 Question}

{i Let {e 𝒜} be a Büchi automaton on transitions. Give a standard Büchi automaton
recognizing the same language as {e 𝒜}, and justify its construction by proving
that both automata recognize the same language. How to generalize the
construction to generalized automata?}

TODO.

{2 Examples}

{3 1. φ = p U Xq}

Let apply the {!section-algo} to the LTL formula φ = p U Xq.

Note that φ is already in NNF, therefore we can go directly to the
{!section-second}.

First, let's calculate all sub-formulas of φ: \{p U Xq; Xq; p; q\}.

Now, let's calculate transitions from the initial state S{_0} = \{p U Xq\}.
S{_0} is not reduced and is of the form α = α{_1} U α{_2}, following transitions
need to be added:

- S{_0} ⟶ \{\} ∪ \{α{_2}\} = \{Xq\}
- S{_0} ⟶ {^φ} \{\} ∪ \{Xα, α{_1}\} = \{X(φ), p\}

Red{_φ}(S{_0}) = \{Xq\}, because it's the only reduced state reachable by a non
marked edge. And the acceptance condition: F{_φ} = \{S{_0} ⟶ next(\{Xq\})\} =
\{S{_0} ⟶ \{q\})\}

{3 2. ψ = G(p ⇒ XFq)}
